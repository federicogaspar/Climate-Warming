# Climate Warming

## Introduction
The idea of this data science project is to prove that climate change is not a scam. For that porpouse, I used temperature data obtained from the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI). The data, stored in data.csv, contains the daily maximum and minimum temperatures observed in 21 U.S. cities from 1961 to 2015.

I used regression analysis to model the climate of different areas in the United States in order to find evidence of global warming. The main goals were

- Create models to analyze and visualize climate change in terms of temperature, and then consider ways to make the data less noisy and obtain clearer temperature change trends. 
- Test the models to see how well historical data can predict future temperatures.
- Investigate a way to model the extremity of temperature, rather than just the increasing temperature.
